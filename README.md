## Introduction

AI.JSX is a framework for building AI applications using Javascript and JSX. It assists dealing with _prompt engineering_, _Document Question + Answering_, and the use of external APIs - all commponents used in building LLM applicaations. 

The Fixie Console, accessible at https://console.fixie.ai, is the web interface where you can create and manage agents, and handle data sources for your applications. It's part of the Fixie platform for building applications with large language models, enabling natural language communication, data access, API calls, and more. For more precise description of Fixie.ai check the blog [Introducing Fixie.ai: A new way to build Large Langue Models](https://www.fixie.ai/blog/introducing-fixie-ai-a-new-way-to-build-with-llms). LLM stands for Large Language Model - a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand, generate, and work with human language at a large scale

## Using Fixie-ai platform in the context of building RedwoodJS applications

**[This repository](https://github.com/adriatic/redwood-ai)** documents the creation, deployment and maintenance of several types of Fixie sidekicks - embeddable conversational assistants (also called agents) that can be integrated alongside your RedwoodJS application under development. Typically such assistant is a part of your application that offers online help. RedwoodJS framework users (application developers) would today often visit the RedwoodJS [online help application](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/index) site, which is manually assembled by RedwoodJS team, using the [Docusaurus tool](https://docusaurus.io/). This tool's motto is **_ship a beautiful documentation site in no time_**.

The most likely reason to use a Fixie sidekick at this (early AI) time, is to _**create a LLM based application**_ that offers online help for the application you are developing. 

As stated in [Getting Started with Fixie](https://fixie.ai/docs/getting-started), Fixie framework consists of several components:

- The Fixie console, which provides a web interface to create, manage, and debug Fixie Agents.
- A set of APIs, which provide a programmatic interface to the Fixie platform.
- The Fixie CLI, providing the command-line interface to the Fixie platform.
- The Fixie SDK, which provides a set of JavaScript interfaces for building Fixie Agents and client applications.

Let's present the two approaches of building [Fixie agents](https://fixie.ai/docs/building-agents). Both approaches start with [setting up your Fixie account](https://fixie.ai/docs/getting-started#setting-up-your-account). The process of [creating the Fixie agent](https://fixie.ai/docs/getting-started#creating-your-first-agent) is described next.

### A- Build Fixie agents directly from the **[Fixie Web console](https://console.fixie.ai/)**


In the subsequent text, we are introducing the simplest approach to 
1. Create Fixie account
following this Fixie Github based document. In this article I am not showing my own Fixie API and Github Fine-grained personal access token.

Once the Fixie account is created, you get the GUI environment to interact with Fixie:

The currently selected tab is the Fixie Dashboard which is empty initially. To continue building your sidekick, you have to visit the Corpora and Agents Tabs.

The Fixie **Corpus** is part of the Fixie platform, designed for building AI applications using large language models (LLMs). The Corpus API allows you to create and manage collections of documents, which can consist of web pages generated by a crawl or uploaded directly. These documents can then be used to ground the model in sources of truth, providing it with the knowledge it needs to answer questions or perform tasks more accurately.

Fixie Corpus API offers to developers a way to interact with and manage these corpora, enhancing the capabilities of AI agents built on the Fixie platform.

This repository documents the creation, deployment and maintenance of several versions of Fixie RedwoodJS sidekicks - all of them helping the RedwoodJS developer creating the RedwoodJS applications, as well as using Fixie.ai itself.

### Create Fixie account

Start by folowing following this [Fixie Github based document](https://github.com/fixie-ai/sidekick-github), describing the workflow to create Fixie Agent  Once the Fixie account is created, you get the platform independent GUI environment to interact with Fixie:
